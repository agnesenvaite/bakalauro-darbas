abstract = {The management of variability plays an important role in successful software product line engineering. There is a need for a universal variability management approach to be consistent and scalable; it should provide traceability between variations at different levels of abstraction and across various generic development artifacts; and there should be a means for visualizing variability. Focusing specifically on the aspect of traceability in the context of such an approach, we define a conceptual variability model that captures variability information in a third dimension, and allows a 1-to-1 mapping of variability between the problem space and the solution space. Decision models, of which the feature model is most popular, are commonly used for, amongst others, managing traceability of variation. These, however, usually reside in a two dimensional space. We analyze the feature model in a small case study with regards to our conceptual variability model, and present our findings.},

@unpublished{Buterin2014,
abstract = {When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was simultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the "bitcoin", a decentralized peer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any backing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So far, the "bitcoin" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi's grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized digital currency. Satoshi's blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin's technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money. Commonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin") as well as more advanced applications such as decentralized exchange, financial derivatives, peer-to-peer gambling and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is "smart contracts" -systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract of the form "A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together can withdraw anything, and A can shut off B's ability to withdraw". The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) -long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and encode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

abstract = {This paper explores how entrepreneurs can use initial coin offerings — whereby they issue crypto tokens and commit to accept only those tokens as payment for future use of a digital platform — to fund venture start-up costs. We show that the ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, which, in turn, reveals consumer value without the entrepreneurs having to know, ex ante, consumer willingness to pay. We find that venture returns are independent of any committed growth in the supply of tokens over time, but that initial funds raised are maximized by setting that growth to zero to encourage saving by early participants. Furthermore, by revealing key aspects of consumer demand, crypto tokens may increase entrepreneurial returns beyond what can be achieved through traditional equity financing. A lack of commitment in monetary policy can, however, undermine saving and, thus, the cost of using tokens to fund start-up costs is potential inflexibility in future capital raising. Crypto tokens can also facilitate coordination among stakeholders within digital ecosystems when network effects are present. JEL Classification Numbers: E42, L12, L26.},

Numer-ous variability modeling approaches exist today to support domain and application engineering activities. Most are based on feature modeling (FM) or decision modeling (DM), but so far no system-atic comparison exists between these two major classes of approaches. Over the last two decades many new features have been added to both FM and DM and it is tough to decide which approach to use for what purpose. This paper clarifies the relation between FM and DM. We aim to systematize the research field of variability mod-eling and to explore potential synergies. We compare multiple as-pects of FM and DM ranging from historical origins and rationale, through syntactic and semantic richness, to tool support, identify-ing commonalities and differences. We hope that this effort will improve the understanding of the range of approaches to variabil-ity modeling by discussing the possible variations. This will pro-vide insights to users considering adopting variability modeling in practice and to designers of new languages, such as the new OMG Common Variability Language.},

abstract = {Systematic Software reuse is a key business strategy that software managers can employ to dramatically improve their software development processes, to decrease time-to-market and costs, and to improve product quality. Effective reuse requires much more than just code and library technology. We have learned that careful consideration must be given to people, process, and technology. One approach to the systematic integration of these three elements is the concept of the software factory. At Hewlett-Packard Co., we have initiated a multifaceted corporate reuse program to help introduce the best practices of systematic reuse into the company, complemented by multidisciplinary research to investigate and develop better methods for domain-specific, reuse-based software engineering. This essay discusses our experiences. Key aspects include domain-specific kits, busi:-tess modeling, organization design, and technology infrastructure for a flexible software factory. T he phrase software crisis was first used in 1969 to describe the ever-increasing burden and frustration that software development and maintenance have placed on otherwise happy and productive organizations. Since then, managers have been looking for effective strategies to deal with software. Manufacturers of computer systems and instruments, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM, whose businesses relied mostly on hardware and mechanical engineers, today find that over 70 percent of their research and development engineers are working in the areas of software and firmware. Maintenance and rework account for about 60 to 80 percent of the total software costs. Systems take longer to produce than expected, and software is frequently on the critical path. by M. L. Griss Among the many solutions proposed to address this software crisis, the systematic application of software reuse to prototyping, development, and maintenance is one of the most effective ways to significantly improve the software process, shorten time-to-market, improve software quality and application consistency, and reduce development and maintenance costs. While many companies are developing proprietary software libraries, software reuse is not yet a major force in most corporate software development. We believe that this is largely because effective reuse depends more on socioeconomic than on technical factors at this time,4,5 while most users still concentrate on library or language technology. In this essay I describe how Hewlett-Packard is directing its efforts to better understand these issues and implement solutions to systematically improve and expand its reuse practice. In the following sections I highlight the business issues, the growing need for flexibility, and a more engineered approach to software. I summarize the status and promise of reuse, stressing the integration of improved process, management, and technology. The library metaphor and model, used for many years to guide work in reuse, needs to be replaced by a software engineering model based on kits, factories, manufacturing, and engineering. Software engineers and managers need to change their view of software reuse from that "Copyright 1993 by International Business Machines Corporation.

Specifically, we propose forgery and impersonation attacks on the one-to-one message encryption and the group message encryption. All of our attacks are feasible with the help of an end-to-end adversary, who has access to the inside of the LINE server (e.g. service provider LINE themselves).

In addition, we found some attacks that even do not need the help of E2E adversary, which shows a critical security flaw of the protocol. Our results reveal that the E2EE scheme of LINE do not sufficiently guarantee the integrity of messages compared to the state-of-the-art E2EE schemes such as Signal, which is used by WhatApp and Facebook Messenger.

abstract = {Systematic discovery and exploitation of commonality across related software systems is a fundamental technical requirement for achieving successful software reuse. By examining a class/family of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems, it is possible to obtain a set of reference models, i.e., software architectures and components needed for implementing applications in the class. FORM (Feature-Oriented Reuse Method) supports development of such reusable architectures and components (through a process called the "domain engineering") and development of applications using the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular domain in terms of services, operating environments, domain technologies, and implementation techniques. The model constructed during the analysis is called a "feature" model, and it captures commonality as an AND/OR graph, where AND nodes indicate mandatory features and OR nodes indicate alternative features selectable for different applications. Then, this model is used to define parameterized reference architectures and appropriate reusable components instantiatable during actual application development. Architectures are defined from three different viewpoints (subsystem, process, and module) and have intimate association with the features. The subsystem architecture is used to package service features and allocate them to different computers in a distributed environment. Each subsystem is further decomposed into processes considering the operating environment features. Modules are defined based on the features on domain technology and implementation techniques. Modules serve as basis for creating reusable components, and their specification defines how they are integrated into the application (e.g.,. as-is integration of pre-coded component, instantiation of parameterized templates, and filling-in skeletal codes). Our experiences have shown that for the electronic bulletin board and the private branch exchange (PBX) domains, "features" make up for a common domain language and the main communication medium among application users and developers. Thus, the feature model well represents a "decision space" of software development, and is a good starting point for identifying candidate reusable components. .},

PBX (Private Branch Exchange) is one such system that requires a high level of adaptability and reusability because of rapidly expanding service features, ever changing communication technology, continuously evolving standards and diverse communication laws and standards in different countries. The software engineering community has made various efforts to address the problem of enhancing software adaptability and reusability. As a result, many programming concepts, such as information hiding, encapsulation, object orientation, abstract data type and modularization, have been developed. Although adequate application of these principles requires the domain or program family perspective, most methods, so far, have been oriented toward developing a single application. FORM (Feature-Oriented Reuse Method), the domain-based software reuse method applied in this paper, concentrates on analyzing and modeling commonalities and differences in applications of a given domain and using the analysis results to develop domain-oriented architectures and software components. The model that captures commonalities and differences is called the 'feature model' and it is used for both the engineering of reusable domain artifacts and the development of actual application software with reusable artifacts. We found that FORM facilitates analysis of variability, as well as commonality, of software before the start of engineering and implementation. With this understanding, adaptability and reusability can be built into software. Also, feature modeling has been found to be an effective method for identifying objects.},

abstract = {Consistency across different lifecycle artifacts is an important issue in software engineering. In software product line engineering, validating consistency becomes even more complicated because product line assets have embedded variabilities. Commonality and variability (C{\&}V) of a software product line (SPL) are usually captured using a feature model. Then, they are embedded into an implementation (i.e., asset code) using various techniques including preprocessor directives. However, the product line asset code often evolves without properly updating other lifecycle artifacts including the variability model, and verification of the consistency of C{\&}V across different product line assets is a major challenge. In this paper, an approach to validating the consistency between C{\&}V expressed in a feature model and C{\&}V embedded in an implementation is proposed. With this approach, product line engineers can have a method for maintaining consistency of C{\&}V across SPL assets systematically. This method has been applied to the flash memory software product line at Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and improvements have been made over the years based on the feedback.},

abstract = {Object-oriented technology is gaining popularity among software engineers with the goal of building reusable and adaptable software. Unfortunately, however, most methods introduced so far are not domain-oriented and do not address the issue of reuse directly. For these methods, software reuse is not the primary goal; it is only a by-product. The feature-oriented reuse method, FORM, is extended in this paper for improving the object-oriented engineering of applications for reuse. FORM concentrates on analyzing and modeling commonalities and differences in the applications of a given domain in terms of capability, operating environment, domain technology, and implementation technique features. These features are used to systematically derive objects that are tied to the features, and to develop reusable and adaptable domain architectures. We found that FORM facilitates analysis of variability (and commonality) of software before engineering and implementation start, and with this understanding, adaptability and reusability can be built into software. Feature modeling has been found to be an effective method for identifying and modeling reusable objects.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Overwriting other methods is viewed as resolving feature interactions and is speciied sep-arately for two features at a time. This programming model allows to compose features (almost) freely in a way which generalizes inheritance and aggregation. For a set of n features, an exponential number of dif-ferent feature combinations is possible, assuming a quadratic number of interaction resolutions. We present the feature model as an extension of Java and give two translations to Java, one via inheritance and the other via aggregation. We further discuss parameterized features, which work nicely with our feature model and can be translated into Pizza, an extension of Java.},

abstract = {"synthetic" because component descriptors are as-Experience on the development, implementation, and deployment of reuse library technology is reported in this paper. The focus is on organizing software collections for reuse using faceted classification. Briefly described are the successful GTE Data Servic-es' Asset Management Program and the steps taken at Contel for furthering reuse technology. The technology developed for reuse libraries is presented first, followed by a description of how it was transferred. The conclusions of the experience are: reuse library technology is available, it is transferable, and it definitely has a positive financial impact on the organization implementing it. 1. THE TECHNOLOGY The central component of the technology reported in this paper is a software reuse library organized around a faceted classification scheme. The system sembled by selecting predefined keywords from facet-ed lists and it provides higher accuracy and flexibility in classification. In contrast, typical classification schemes such as Library of Congress and Dewey Decimal are enumerative. In an enumerative scheme all possible classes are predefined. The librarian selects the class that best fit the attributes of the new item by traversing the classification hierarchy. In the Dewey Decimal system [8], for example, the title Structured Systems Programming could be classified in any of the following classes: systems analysis (001.61), software (001.642 5), systems (0031, systems analysis (from the technology branch, 620.72) or systems construction (620.73). To compensate for such ambiguity cross references are established, but cross referencing is a cumbersome and error-prone process. The faceted approach, in contrast, synthesizes a new class, tailored to the particular title or component. In a faceted scheme developed for Unix components , for example, the class supports search and retrieval of reusable components , and librarian functions such as cataloging and classification. To be effective, the system must operate within the context of an organizational infrastructure aimed at promoting reusability. 1ocateAine-number/fileAine-editor was synthesized using terms from four facets and may only be applicable t o one component.},

abstract = {During their usage, software systems have to be changed constantly. If such changes are implemented in an incomplete or inconsistent way a loss of architectural quality will occur, i.e. in terms of maintainability and understand-ability. The lack of traceability of the impact of changed requirements in the software enhances this effect. Trace-ability links have been proposed as a link between the requirements and the different parts of a solution. In practical use, these links are difficult to establish and maintain. Currently, tools cannot effectively support these links due to human-required decisions. This paper introduces feature models as an intermediate element for linking requirements to design models. They enable a more appropriate bridging of the different levels of abstraction. Feature models group sets of requirements to a feature and enable a modeling of the variability of requirements. The feature models structure traceability links between requirements , design elements and implementation parts. This leads to lower efforts of establishing and maintaining the links. Furthermore, descriptions of design decisions can be attached to the links. Industrial experience with this approach shows its support for the evolutionary development of large software systems, especially in the improved comprehension of the changes by the developers.},

Topics include: ■ Concepts, features, and functionality of Bitcoin and the blockchain ■ Using the blockchain for automated tracking of all digital endeavors ■ Enabling censorship-resistant organizational models ■ Creating a decentralized digital repository to verify identity ■ Possibility of cheaper, more efficient services traditionally provided by nations ■ Blockchain for science: making better use of the data-mining network ■ Personal health record storage, including access to one's own genomic data ■ Open access academic publishing on the blockchain This book is part of an ongoing O'Reilly series. Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies introduces Bitcoin and describes the technology behind Bitcoin and the blockchain. Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy considers the theoretical, philosophical, and societal impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.},

abstract = {Genetic Programming is a method for evolving functions that find approximate or exact solutions to problems. There are many problems that traditional Genetic Programming (GP) cannot solve, due to the theoretical limitations of its paradigm. A Turing machine (TM) is a theoretical abstraction that express the extent of the computational power of algorithms. Any system that is Turing complete is sufficiently powerful to recognize all possible algorithms. GP is not Turing complete. This paper will prove that when GP is combined with the technique of indexed memory, the resulting system is Turing complete. This means that, in theory, GP with indexed memory can be used to evolve any algorithm.},

@article{Thelwall2001,
abstract = {The content of the web has increasingly become a focus for academic research. Computer programs are needed in order to conduct any large-scale processing of web pages, requiring the use of a web crawler at some stage in order to fetch the pages to be analysed. The processing of the text of web pages in order to extract information can be expensive in terms of processor time. Consequently a distributed design is pro-posed in order to effectively use idle computing resources and to help information scientists avoid the need to employ dedicated equipment. A system developed using the model is examined and the advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the concept of Cloud Computing to achieve a complete definition of what a Cloud is, using the main characteristics typically associated with this paradigm in the literature. More than 20 definitions have been studied allowing for the extraction of a consensus definition as well as a minimum definition containing the essential characteristics. This paper pays much attention to the Grid paradigm, as it is often confused with Cloud technologies. We also describe the relationships and distinctions between the Grid and Cloud approaches.},
