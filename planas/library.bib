abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

abstract = {A key aspect of variability management in software product families is the explicit representation of the variability . Experiences at several industrial software development companies have shown that a software variability model (1) should uniformly represent variation points as first class entities in all abstraction layers (ranging from features to code) and (2) allow for hierarchical organization of the variability . It furthermore (3) should allow for first class representation of simple , i . e . one - to - one , and complex , i . e . n - to - m , dependencies , and (4) allow for modeling the relations between dependencies . Existing variability modeling approaches only support the first two requirements , but lack support for the latter two . The contribution of this paper is a framework for variability modeling , COVAMOF , that provides support for all four requirements .},

abstract = {Variability modeling is essential for defining and managing the commonalities and variabilities in software product lines. Numer-ous variability modeling approaches exist today to support domain and application engineering activities. Most are based on feature modeling (FM) or decision modeling (DM), but so far no system-atic comparison exists between these two major classes of approaches. Over the last two decades many new features have been added to both FM and DM and it is tough to decide which approach to use for what purpose. This paper clarifies the relation between FM and DM. We aim to systematize the research field of variability mod-eling and to explore potential synergies. We compare multiple as-pects of FM and DM ranging from historical origins and rationale, through syntactic and semantic richness, to tool support, identify-ing commonalities and differences. We hope that this effort will improve the understanding of the range of approaches to variabil-ity modeling by discussing the possible variations. This will pro-vide insights to users considering adopting variability modeling in practice and to designers of new languages, such as the new OMG Common Variability Language.},

abstract = {Systematic discovery and exploitation of commonality across related software systems is a fundamental technical requirement for achieving successful software reuse. By examining a class/family of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems, it is possible to obtain a set of reference models, i.e., software architectures and components needed for implementing applications in the class. FORM (Feature-Oriented Reuse Method) supports development of such reusable architectures and components (through a process called the "domain engineering") and development of applications using the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular domain in terms of services, operating environments, domain technologies, and implementation techniques. The model constructed during the analysis is called a "feature" model, and it captures commonality as an AND/OR graph, where AND nodes indicate mandatory features and OR nodes indicate alternative features selectable for different applications. Then, this model is used to define parameterized reference architectures and appropriate reusable components instantiatable during actual application development. Architectures are defined from three different viewpoints (subsystem, process, and module) and have intimate association with the features. The subsystem architecture is used to package service features and allocate them to different computers in a distributed environment. Each subsystem is further decomposed into processes considering the operating environment features. Modules are defined based on the features on domain technology and implementation techniques. Modules serve as basis for creating reusable components, and their specification defines how they are integrated into the application (e.g.,. as-is integration of pre-coded component, instantiation of parameterized templates, and filling-in skeletal codes). Our experiences have shown that for the electronic bulletin board and the private branch exchange (PBX) domains, "features" make up for a common domain language and the main communication medium among application users and developers. Thus, the feature model well represents a "decision space" of software development, and is a good starting point for identifying candidate reusable components. .},

@unpublished{Buterin2014,
abstract = {When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was simultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the "bitcoin", a decentralized peer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any backing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So far, the "bitcoin" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi's grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized digital currency. Satoshi's blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin's technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money. Commonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin") as well as more advanced applications such as decentralized exchange, financial derivatives, peer-to-peer gambling and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is "smart contracts" -systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract of the form "A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together can withdraw anything, and A can shut off B's ability to withdraw". The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) -long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and encode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

@article{Catalini2018,
abstract = {This paper explores how entrepreneurs can use initial coin offerings — whereby they issue crypto tokens and commit to accept only those tokens as payment for future use of a digital platform — to fund venture start-up costs. We show that the ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, which, in turn, reveals consumer value without the entrepreneurs having to know, ex ante, consumer willingness to pay. We find that venture returns are independent of any committed growth in the supply of tokens over time, but that initial funds raised are maximized by setting that growth to zero to encourage saving by early participants. Furthermore, by revealing key aspects of consumer demand, crypto tokens may increase entrepreneurial returns beyond what can be achieved through traditional equity financing. A lack of commitment in monetary policy can, however, undermine saving and, thus, the cost of using tokens to fund start-up costs is potential inflexibility in future capital raising. Crypto tokens can also facilitate coordination among stakeholders within digital ecosystems when network effects are present. JEL Classification Numbers: E42, L12, L26.},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

LINE is one of the most widely-deployed instant messaging applications, especially in East Asia. By a close inspection of their protocols, we give several attacks against the message integrity of Letter Sealing. Specifically, we propose forgery and impersonation attacks on the one-to-one message encryption and the group message encryption. All of our attacks are feasible with the help of an end-to-end adversary, who has access to the inside of the LINE server (e.g. service provider LINE themselves). We stress that the main purpose of E2EE is to provide a protection against the end-to-end adversary. In addition, we found some attacks that even do not need the help of E2E adversary, which shows a critical security flaw of the protocol. Our results reveal that the E2EE scheme of LINE do not sufficiently guarantee the integrity of messages compared to the state-of-the-art E2EE schemes such as Signal, which is used by WhatApp and Facebook Messenger. We also provide some countermeasures against our attacks. We have shared our findings with LINE corporation in advance. The LINE corporation has confirmed our attacks are valid as long as the E2E adversary is involved, and officially recognizes our results as a vulnerability of encryption break.},

Practically, all chemical management programs like the OECD HPV Program, EU REACH, or the Canadian DSL Categorization are planning to use or are already using categorization approaches to reduce resources including animal testing. The aim of the study was to discuss the feasibility to apply computational structural similarity methods to augment formation of a category. The article discusses also how this understanding can be translated into computer readable format, an ultimate need for practical, broad scope applications. We conclude that for the skin sensitization endpoint, used as a working example, mechanistic understanding expressed as chemical reactivity can be exploited by computational structural similarity methods to augment category formation process. We propose a novel method, atom environments ranking (AER), to assess similarity to a reference training set representing a common mechanism of action, as a potential method for grouping chemicals into reactivity domains.},

abstract = {Genetic Programming is a method for evolving functions that find approximate or exact solutions to problems. There are many problems that traditional Genetic Programming (GP) cannot solve, due to the theoretical limitations of its paradigm. A Turing machine (TM) is a theoretical abstraction that express the extent of the computational power of algorithms. Any system that is Turing complete is sufficiently powerful to recognize all possible algorithms. GP is not Turing complete. This paper will prove that when GP is combined with the technique of indexed memory, the resulting system is Turing complete. This means that, in theory, GP with indexed memory can be used to evolve any algorithm.},

abstract = {Systematic Software reuse is a key business strategy that software managers can employ to dramatically improve their software development processes, to decrease time-to-market and costs, and to improve product quality. Effective reuse requires much more than just code and library technology. We have learned that careful consideration must be given to people, process, and technology. One approach to the systematic integration of these three elements is the concept of the software factory. At Hewlett-Packard Co., we have initiated a multifaceted corporate reuse program to help introduce the best practices of systematic reuse into the company, complemented by multidisciplinary research to investigate and develop better methods for domain-specific, reuse-based software engineering. This essay discusses our experiences. Key aspects include domain-specific kits, busi:-tess modeling, organization design, and technology infrastructure for a flexible software factory. T he phrase software crisis was first used in 1969 to describe the ever-increasing burden and frustration that software development and maintenance have placed on otherwise happy and productive organizations. Since then, managers have been looking for effective strategies to deal with software. Manufacturers of computer systems and instruments, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM, whose businesses relied mostly on hardware and mechanical engineers, today find that over 70 percent of their research and development engineers are working in the areas of software and firmware. Maintenance and rework account for about 60 to 80 percent of the total software costs. Systems take longer to produce than expected, and software is frequently on the critical path. by M. L. Griss Among the many solutions proposed to address this software crisis, the systematic application of software reuse to prototyping, development, and maintenance is one of the most effective ways to significantly improve the software process, shorten time-to-market, improve software quality and application consistency, and reduce development and maintenance costs. While many companies are developing proprietary software libraries, software reuse is not yet a major force in most corporate software development. We believe that this is largely because effective reuse depends more on socioeconomic than on technical factors at this time,4,5 while most users still concentrate on library or language technology. In this essay I describe how Hewlett-Packard is directing its efforts to better understand these issues and implement solutions to systematically improve and expand its reuse practice. In the following sections I highlight the business issues, the growing need for flexibility, and a more engineered approach to software. I summarize the status and promise of reuse, stressing the integration of improved process, management, and technology. The library metaphor and model, used for many years to guide work in reuse, needs to be replaced by a software engineering model based on kits, factories, manufacturing, and engineering. Software engineers and managers need to change their view of software reuse from that "Copyright 1993 by International Business Machines Corporation.

abstract = {Bitcoin is starting to come into its own as a digital currency, but the blockchain technology behind it could prove to be much more significant. This book takes you beyond the currency (" Blockchain 1.0 ") and smart contracts (" Blockchain 2.0 ") to demonstrate how the blockchain is in position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking. Author Melanie Swan, Founder of the Institute for Blockchain Studies, explains that the blockchain is essentially a public ledger with potential as a worldwide, decentralized record for the registration, inventory, and transfer of all assets—not just finances, but property and intangible assets such as votes, software, health data, and ideas. Topics include: ■ Concepts, features, and functionality of Bitcoin and the blockchain ■ Using the blockchain for automated tracking of all digital endeavors ■ Enabling censorship-resistant organizational models ■ Creating a decentralized digital repository to verify identity ■ Possibility of cheaper, more efficient services traditionally provided by nations ■ Blockchain for science: making better use of the data-mining network ■ Personal health record storage, including access to one's own genomic data ■ Open access academic publishing on the blockchain This book is part of an ongoing O'Reilly series. Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies introduces Bitcoin and describes the technology behind Bitcoin and the blockchain. Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy considers the theoretical, philosophical, and societal impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.},

In this paper, we propose a cardinality-based notation for feature modeling, which integrates a number of existing extensions of previous approaches. We then introduce and motivate the novel concept of staged configura-tion. Staged configuration can be achieved by the stepwise specialization of feature models. This is important because in a realistic development process, different groups and different people eliminate product variabil-ity in different stages. We also indicate how cardinality-based feature models and their specialization can be given a precise formal semantics.},

Feature modeling is one of the most popular domain analysis techniques , which analyzes commonality and variability in a domain to develop highly reusable core assets for a product line . Various attempts have been made to extend and apply it to the development of software product lines . However , feature modeling can be difficult and time - consuming without a pre - cise understanding of the goals of feature modeling and the aid of practical guidelines . In this paper , we clarify the concept of features and the goals of fea - ture modeling , and provide practical guidelines for successful product line soft - ware engineering .
